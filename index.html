	<p>The sports originates back as early as 1100 CE in what is now Canada. It was played by various Native Americans, like the Eastern Woodlands and some Plain Indian tribes. Lacrosse is one of the oldest sports in North America and has changed drastically over time. Even though lacrosse originated in modern Canada, it was extremely popular in the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and American South regions. When the game was first played, there were a lot less regulations like we have today. Anywhere from one hundred to one thousand men could play at one time, and the game could last several days! Native Americans believed Lacrosse served many purposes. Some games were played to settle disputes within the tribe and kept the tribe from splitting apart. Other games were played for fitness and to train young men to become warriors and be ready for combat! And finally, maybe the most important function of the game was for religious purposes. They say tribes played “for the pleasure of the Creator”.</p>

	<p>Back when Lacrosse originated, the men used wooden sticks and clay balls, with no pads. In today’s time, players use metal sticks, plastics heads, rubber balls, and various pads. The pads include: a helmet, shoulder pads, elbow/arm pads, gloves, and cleats. Because of the various equipment you need in order to play the game, it becomes very expensive. The two most important pieces of equipment, the helmet and the stick, are obviously the most expensive of the bunch. The stick consists of two parts, the shaft and the head. Shafts can range anywhere from $60 to well over $100, while the head can range anywhere from $35 to a little over $100. The other main equipment item would be the helmet. Helmets usually, depending on the model and customization, are priced from $130 to $400. The other pads like gloves, arm guards, shoulder pads, and cleats all vary in price. There are some pads that go for cheap like $30, and then there are other pads that go for over $100. Overall THE SPORT IS EXPENSIVE!</p>

	<p style="margin-top:20px"></p>
	<p>Today lacrosse is mainly played in the North East and the Mid-Atlantic. However, what does the future hold for this great game? As we have seen over the recent years, states in the south and the west are beginning to adopt the game. It all really begins with the growth of the college game. We now are seeing NCAA programs being started down south and out west. Most notably, colleges like Jacksonville University and University of Denver are spreading the game. With those two programs established in the NCAA, more and more rec leagues, high schools, and lower division colleges are adopting lacrosse. For example, some of the best college recruits recently have come out of Texas and California. The most recent university to establish a varsity program is the University of Utah. In the pro leagues, there are teams established along the east coast, in Canada, and now in Dallas & San Diego. The game is definitely expanding, however it’s at a slow rate. But none the less, the sport is not disappearing anytime soon, and is gaining more support every day!</p>
